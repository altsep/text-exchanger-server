## Description

Express-based server and React client built in Vite dev environment. The app allows exchanging text information through randomly named pages. No database is used, text data is stored in server's file system along with creator's id and creation date as plain text or json files respectively, using page's path as a folder name.

## Purpose

Funnily enough, it wasn't my intent to end up with a messaging app prototype. The idea was to make the exchange closer to a game one could play with a friend, where one cannot see what the other person wants them to read before they revealed it with a click, while making it more readable than an average messaging or text storage app, closer to typographic experience, so that people could enjoy their time.

## To-do

- Font size / family options
- Break long text on separate sections and allow to switch between them
- Accessibility
